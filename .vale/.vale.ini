# proselint.Needless considers a host of terms "needless" which are natural and wide-spread changes in the English language,
# and is clearly favouring US changes rather than others (the US isn't the only or even the largest English speaking country).
# You don't have to look far to find examples of this rule preferring variants of terms in line with 18th century elite preferences:
# https://www.merriam-webster.com/grammar/preventive-or-preventative
# In other words, it's a linguistic prescriptive holdover to insist on some of these terms being "needless" when they're in
# fact widespread and well understood. Not all the terms have this issue, but we'd have to rewrite
# practically the entire rule to sort out which ones we cared about. If we find any we _do_ care about, we can add them to our
# own substitution rule.
